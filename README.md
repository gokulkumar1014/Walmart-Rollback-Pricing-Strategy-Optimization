## 🔍 Objectives
- Predict revenue contribution from rollback discount strategies
- Identify the most revenue-generating customer segments
- Use Recency (R) and Monetary value (M) to build predictive models
- Optimize marketing decisions based on data-driven insights

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Missing values in demographic attributes (gender and age) handled using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Customer distribution by demographic groups and rollback levels.
- **Regression Modeling:** Built predictive models to estimate revenue using recency and monetary values as key predictors.
- **Model Interpretation:** Regression coefficients and statistical significance analyzed to understand driving factors.
